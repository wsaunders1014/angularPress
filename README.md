angularPress
============

Angular Blog platform I'm making to learn Angular JS.
Ideally it would be a sort of Tumblr-esque app made in AngularJS. It uses Firebase as a backend and user authorization server.
Using Boostrap as a front end, but very little styling has been done, mostly just using it for the built in form styles right now.


Current Bugs:
When a user creates an account they are not immediately logged in.

User must go to another page in the app in order for the feed to load correctly.
